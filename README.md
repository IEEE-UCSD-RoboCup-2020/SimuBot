# SimuBot
AI software specifically designed to run the virtual robots in the GrSim simulator

## Dependencies
* Linux/MacOS
* grSim simulator for RoboCup SSL
* Google protobuf library version 3.11.4 (libprotoc 3.11.4)
* Jave 14.0.1 JRE 14.0.1+7
* Apache Ant version 1.10.5

## Project Structure
* source code under src/SimuBot/*.java
* Proto packet definition under src/Proto
* src/Protobuf/*.java are java files autogenerated by running ./compile.sh in src/Proto

## Build and Run

* build project by running "ant" under root directory, ant builds the project using definitions in build.xml

* run the program by either of the two following ways

  * ```shell
    ant Runner
    ```

  * ```shell
    ./run.sh
    ```



## Known Issues

* Currently only support single camera configuration (for coding simplicity) since grSim simulates the game setup (virtual setup) with only one global vision camera. (number of cameras for the physical setup varies depending on the actual competition setup)
* Number of robots per team is fixed to 6, this can be manually changed by modifying the DetectionType.java file, along with modifying the way how VisionConnection class handles the data packet, typically by changing the number of iterations needed to obtain the full information from multiple consecutive packets. (single packet usually misses few robot's data)
